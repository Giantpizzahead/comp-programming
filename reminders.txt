Don't rush, make sure you know what you're going to code before you start coding it

Test your code in small chunks

Make sure you reset ALL your variables after each test case

Check edge cases (N = 1)

When reconstructing DP, make sure to explicitly use a from array (don't risk the chance of DP bugging out)

If segfault, try setting stack size to unlimited (ulimit -s unlimited)
