Remember:
Don't rush. Take it slow. You have plenty of time.
There are no easy problems on USACO contests, but there aren't any super hard ones either.
"Become" the problem. Understand the problem fully before thinking about the solution.
Use different points of view; try different approaches if one isn't working.
Set an alarm for 2 hours into the contest, and take a break at halftime. Go downstairs, relax a bit.
