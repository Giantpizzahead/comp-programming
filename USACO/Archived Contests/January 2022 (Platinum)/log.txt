Good luck and have fun. You got this :)

4:00 - Start of contest, on 1
3:24 - Implementing 1
3:01 - Initial submit for 1, got expected kinda (went on wrong sol path for first 45 mins)
2:42 - Got solution idea for 1, implementing
2:01 - Got 30% for 1, have the right runtime, optimizing to get full
1:44 - Can't optimize 1 for some reason, moving on for now
1:28 - 3 might be convex hull? Risky to try though, moving to 2
0:35 - 1s a lost cause, just get partials
0:11 - Partials on 2, on to trying 1 again
0:01 - Got as many partials as I'm gonna be able to get

This was tough. :(
