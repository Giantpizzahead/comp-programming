Remember:
Log your time. Set an alarm every hour to keep on track.
Don't get stuck on one way of trying a problem.
If you aren't making progress, switch to another problem, then come back with a fresh perspective.
Make sure you have the details worked out before coding.
The goal is to get as many points as possible, not to full solve. Don't risk it.
