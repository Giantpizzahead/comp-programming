US Open 2015 Contest (Mock)

Start time - 3/27/20, 3:20 PM
Time limit - 5 hours

Final score - 1000/1000
Distribution - 15/15, 12/12, 15/15

So, as the statistics indicated, this US Open contest was much easier than an average
US Open contest. I was hoping this would be a good mock to use for the US Open, but I'm
probably going to have to find another, harder mock. Anyways, it was still fun to try,
and I'm happy that I got a perfect score! :D

5:00 - Start of contest
5:00 - Started #1
4:35 - Strategy done for #1
4:21 - Initial submit for #1, got AC... in <1 ms? With Java???? (USACO tests are bugged)
It works on my edge case tests, so I'm going to give it AC. It never uses >70000 queries
either. Soooooo AC! (15/15)
4:16 - Started #2
4:07 - Strategy done for #2
3:58 - Realized strategy for #2 was flawed
3:54 - Pen died mid contest... fun
3:52 - Revised strategy done for #2
3:38 - Initial submit for #2, got AC! (12/12)
3:37 - Started #3
3:22 - Strategy done for #3
3:02 - Initial submit for #3, got WAs (5/15)
2:52 - Resubmit after fixing a small bug, got AC! (15/15)
2:52 - Contest over because I ACed everything early (way too early for a US Open contest)
