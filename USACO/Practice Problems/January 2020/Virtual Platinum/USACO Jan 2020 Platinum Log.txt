USACO January 2020 Platinum Log
Time limit - 3.5 hours
Start time - 4:10 PM, 2/15/20

Final score - 690/1000
Distribution - 15/15, 6/12, 8/14

Well, this was... interesting. #3 was still really weird. Anyways, I did pretty good on time
management there. #3 really messed me up though. Then again, both 2 and 3 were hard...
The time I spent on each of the problems was about right (<30 minutes on the easy one, with
about 50/50 on the other 2). I guess I've got some more studying to do.
Hey, on the plus side, I would've tied for top 6 in the actual contest, which is well above my
goal. Yay! :)

3:30 - Start of contest
3:25 - Strategy done for #1
3:10 - Initial submit for #1
3:09 - Finished #1 (First try!)
3:09 - Started #2
2:49 - Skip #2 for now
2:35 - Strategy done for #3 (hard implementation incoming!)
1:30 - Initial submit for #3 (very messy code)
1:19 - Got 8/14 cases on #3! (still messy code, don't know what's wrong)
1:10 - Settling for 8/14 on #3 for now because I still have no idea what is wrong
1:06 - Some kind of strategy done for #2, going to try and implement it
0:32 - Initial submit for #2 (clean code! :D), got 4/12 cases
0:18 - Resorting to coding another special case for N <= 1000 to get 6/12 cases for #2
0:09 - First submit with special case coded
0:06 - Grading server seems to be bugged, so if it doesn't submit in time, I'll extend the contest a bit.
0:03 - Got 6/12 cases on #2
0:01 - Attempting to fix #3
0:00 - Didn't fix #3, contest is over!
-0:35 - Still can't fix #3, wasn't a bug with my messy code. I'm just gonna take the 8/14.
