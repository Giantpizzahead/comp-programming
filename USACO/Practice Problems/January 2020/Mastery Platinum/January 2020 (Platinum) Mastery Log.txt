USACO January 2020 Platinum (Mock Mastery)

Contest start time - 5:26 PM
Time limit - 3.5 hours

Final score - 889/1000
Distribution - 15/15, 8/12, 14/14

This was a pretty good mastery contest. Things went much better than they should have; I
lucked out on #3, and somehow managed to get it first try! With 2 minutes left too! Again,
I spent a bit too much time trying to optimize #2. However, the reason I was slow on #2
is because of my unfamiliarity with inverse matrices, so it makes sense. Anyways, I'm
satisfied with this mastery level, and I'm glad that my implementation skills are still
top notch. :D
