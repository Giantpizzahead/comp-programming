Since the US Open 2015 mock I took was too easy, I'm going to use this as a harder mock
contest. The time limit isn't exactly 5 hours, but oh well.
I'm only going to do the first 2 problems, as I have seen / implemented #3 before, and
also cause I'm starting this contest a bit late.

USACO February 2015 Gold (Mock)

Start time - 3/28/20, 7:20 PM
Time limit - 2.5 hours (2 problems only, also cause #3 seems to be the hardest)

Final score - 666/666
Distribution - 15/15, 15/15

Alright, I feel prepared for the US Open now. Here I come... tomorrow, actually. Still,
this was good training. I'm gonna go relax now. :)
