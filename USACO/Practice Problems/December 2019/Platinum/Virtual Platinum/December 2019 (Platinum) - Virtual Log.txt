1:25 - Room walkaround, 2nd edition
1:13 - Start better implementation O(N^3)
0:56 - First submit attempt for better implementation (still only 10)
0:45 - All cases correct! But with over 500 MB memory, so trying to get it down to 256
0:40 - Finished #3! (185 MB memory max, all under 2 seconds... we did it! :D)
0:27 - Explanation for #3 done... so we're done!
