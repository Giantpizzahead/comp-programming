US Open 2014 Gold (Mock Contest)
Start time - 4:05 PM, 3/19/20
Time limit - 5 hours

Final score - 567/1000
Distribution - 7/10, 8/10, 2/10

Predicted score with extended time limit - 733/1000
Predicted distribution - 10/10, 9/10, 3/10

This went about as well as it could've. It was a challenge all right; the problems were
all quite hard, and I had to be really careful when implementing some of them. However, the
score above isn't exactly accurate; at this time, Java didn't get an extended time limit,
causing some of the test cases in all the problems to TLE when they really shouldn't have.
Either way, this was a fun contest, and I think it helps me realize the difficulty of the
US Open. Alright then, time to keep studying! :D

Note: Time was also a bit of an issue here. I spent too long on #1, leaving me too little
time to work on #3. I got 6/10 (probably more with Java's extended time limit) on that one
about 30 minutes after the contest ended. So, that's something I should keep in mind for
next contest.

5:00 - Start of contest
5:00 - Started #1
4:32 - Strategy done for #1
3:08 - Initial submit for #1, got some right and some wrong and some TLE?????? (7/10)
2:59 - Moved on from #1 for now, started #2
2:42 - Strategy done for #2, moving on to #3 first
2:34 - Back to #2
1:45 - Initial submit for #2, got 3/10
1:33 - Got 7/10!
1:30 - 8/10...!
1:28 - Back to #1
1:09 - 7/10 restored on #1 (I accidentally lost it earlier)
1:08 - Back to #3
0:46 - Partial solution found for #3, decided to implement it due to time
0:31 - Initial submit for #3, got 2/10 with naive method
0:13 - First submit for #3 using a smarter method, still 2/10
0:00 - End of contest... but I'm gonna keep trying #3. I'm close... I can feel it!
-0:05 - 3/10 on #3
-0:30 - Taking a look at the test data for #3
-0:34 - Realized that I am dumb and somehow messed up the fact that Strings don't magically
revert to their original state after being used in recursion
-0:36 - Resubmit, got 6/10! Wow...........................................................
-1:07 - Fixed the 'edge case' for #2, now at 9/10 (had to do with barn sim hitting (0, 0))
-1:08 - Ok, I'm going to end it here.
