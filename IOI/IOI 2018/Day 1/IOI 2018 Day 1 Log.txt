Time limit - 5 hours

Final score - 186/300

Wow. This was a hard one. IOI 2009 was a joke compared to this. The first problem was easy(ish), but the other 2 were crazy. #2 had so many hints, but I just couldn't find the right way to solve it. I ended up getting subtasks 1-3 though. Same thing with #3; I felt so close to the solution, but I just couldn't get it. Again, I got the subtasks that I could solve (ST 1-3), so I'm happy with my decision there. There were some technical difficulties due to Yandex only allowing C++ submissions, but the contest was still really fun overall!
I can already tell this contest mastery is going to be super wholesome... Ohhh yeah. I can't wait!

5:00 - Start of contest
5:00 - Started #1
4:30 - Skipped #1 for now, started #2
4:14 - Skipped #2 for now, started #3... Wow. This contest is hard.
3:54 - Solution found for Subtasks 1-3 for #3... should I go for ST 4?
3:45 - Strategy done for #3, going for Subtasks 1-3
3:02 - Initial submit for #3...
Uh oh. Yandex only allows C++ submissions. Oh no... This is gonna be a bit of an issue.
Ok, hold on a sec. I'm gonna go and try using the judge that I made for IOI 2019. Pausing the contest timer for now.

So we have issues. My judge doesn't work for IOI 2018 because the formats are completely different (why IOI)... soooooo we're gonna have to write our code in C++. Yay!
I probably should've checked this before I started the contest, but Yandex worked for IOI 2009, so I assumed it would also work for 2018. Oh well. I guess we'll have to compromise...
To make up for this issue, I'm gonna reset the timer to 3:45 (before I made the Java code for #3). Alright, let's do this!

3:45 - Timer reset due to fun issues

Ok, forget that. I can't write C++ code that's this complex just yet. We're switching back to running random cases and checking the results manually.

3:36 - Initial submit for #3
3:27 - Passed all my manual tests for ST 3, so I'm giving it AC for ST 3. (34/100)
3:26 - Back to #1
3:25 - Strategy done for #1 (I misread the problem before cause I'm dumb)
3:12 - Initial submit for #1, got AC (100/100)! :D
3:09 - Back to #2
2:26 - Strategy for Subtasks 1, 2, and 4 done, but I can't find the trick for the others.
2:06 - Gave up on #2 for now, back to #3
1:35 - Executive decision to give up on ST 4 for #3, and just implement ST 1 and 2
1:28 - Submit for #3 targeting ST 1-3, got AC on those subtasks! (49/100)
1:22 - Back to #2
1:06 - Strategy found for #2, Subtasks 1-4
1:04 - Settling for Subtasks 1-4 for #2
0:44 - Initial submit for #2 targeting ST 1-3, got AC on those subtasks (31/100)
0:36 - Implementing ST 4
0:25 - Submit for #4 targeting ST 4, got AC on that subtask (37/100)
0:20 - I'm gonna end the contest here, as I don't see myself getting any more points on the other subtasks. Wow. That was hard.
