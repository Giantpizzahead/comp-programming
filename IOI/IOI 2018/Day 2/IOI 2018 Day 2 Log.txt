IOI 2018 Day 2 (Mock Contest)
Start time - 4:12 PM
Time limit - 5 hours

Final score - 123/300
Distribution - 53/100, 51/100, 19/100

So... this one didn't go that well. In fact, it went even worse than Day 1's contest. I didn't manage
to AC any of the tasks, which is kinda sad. But oh well. I knew that IOI 2018 was going to be a wakeup
call for me, and I was right. Hey, now I got some problems to practice! :)
#1 was hard-ish to implement, but I couldn't figure out how to reduce the number of switches used
past the filled tree. #2 was really interesting, and I ended up with some overly complex code to
solve the tree version of it. I still don't know what to do with a general graph though. Finally,
#3 looked easy, but was actually reallllly hard. I was originally going for ST 1-4, but I think I
left myself too little time for the problem in order to make that happen. My time spending on #1 was
probably too long (42 minutes after 53/100!), so that's something I can work on next time.
This was a fun experience; I'm looking forward to taking more hard contests like these! :D

Side note: Many things probably impacted my abilities during this contest; for one, my hands were
freezing at the time. Another thing is the coronavirus; HHS closed the day before this contest, so
that probably distracted me a bit. Anyways, conditions during this one weren't optimal, so that might
explain a bit of the issues I had. Still, there are quite a few things I can improve on. So, let's
get working!
